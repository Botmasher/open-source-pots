## Hubot
- project: https://github.com/hubotio/hubot
- contributing: https://github.com/hubotio/hubot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
- thoughts:
	- very welcoming text
	- uses CoffeeScript
	- mostly elaborated path to get started
	- clear boundaries on how to contribute (but less on what)
	- work on chat (Slack)
	- triage issues
	- recommended to work on Hubot Evolution process https://github.com/hubotio/evolution
	- small number of open issues
	- little response to GitHub issues
		- many of the ones that are there are short
		- some just "try this" and code or pic
	- coverage seems like it could use improving
	- source code seems juggleable in head
	- there's a [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/hubotio/hubot/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)
		- current tasks are around maintenance and community
		- future project tasks must go through Hubot Evolution
		- future project task #1 is going from CoffeeScript to JavaScript

## Gnome
- project: https://wiki.gnome.org/Newcomers
- contributing: https://wiki.gnome.org/Newcomers/FurtherReading
- thoughts:
	- well laid-out page for funneling newcomers to specific projects
	- a whole bunch of tools to choose from to get involved
	- praises respect and patience
	- uses IRC, mailing lists, and pushes to [GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME)
	- I see js, xml, shell scripting, Python... and lots of C
	- some of the projects to get involved in: https://wiki.gnome.org/Newcomers/ChooseProject
	- obviously there's a need to install and test these things

## Habitica
- project: https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica
- contributing: http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Blacksmiths
- thoughts:
	- cool concept to make your everyday tasks an RPG
	- JS, lots of Vue and CSS
	- many different scripts and files to get a handle on
	- shields show poor scores
	- they give a lot of guidance for "Blacksmiths" (link above)
	- the project expects a lot of prep work upfront from contributors
	- well labeled issues
	- hundreds of open issues
	- PRs show a lot were recently unsuccessful in Travis CI build and increasing coverage
	- probably the most visual of the projects here

## Mozilla
- project: https://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/
- contributing: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute
- thoughts:
	- there is a lot going on here!
	- many subprojects, seems like much more than GNOME
	- easy to see who is responsible for what
	- take a fun quiz for yourself and see what's recommended: https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/
	- a lot more to read and sort through yourself but still open and nice

## Ava
- project: https://github.com/avajs/ava/
- contributing: https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/contributing.md
- thoughts:
	- Node.js I/O testing that runs tests concurrently
		- tests are atomic, not dependent on global state or other tests' state
	- it's all JS
	- documentation includes plenty of code examples to follow along
	- a more straightforward, less bubbly, detail-oriented community
	- get good at testing
	- understand the difference between Promises and Observables
	- lots of issues to contribute to
	- clearly labeled [beginner issues](https://github.com/avajs/ava/labels/good%20for%20beginner)
	- will require using to get a handle on how to contribute

## atom
- project: https://github.com/atom/Atom
- contributing: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
- thoughts:
	- lots of open issues
	- seems like a very active community
	- clear documentation for exactly how to learn, contribute, submit
	- a big project with many pieces to juggle in the codebase
	- how to change and test core: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/
	- getting PR to pass CircleCI, AppVeyor, Travis CI seems about 50% at a glance
	- JavaScript with a fair bit of CoffeeScript
	- make sure to keep up with significant decisions: https://github.com/atom/design-decisions
