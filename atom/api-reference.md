# Atom API Reference

Notes on what I'm discovering and reinforcing as I make my way through the [API Reference](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.27.2/) after reading the Flight Manual.

## AtomEnvironment
- global class
- packages, themes, menus, window
- can get to references to specific instances like:
  - `::grammars` for a `GrammarRegistry` - get, add, subscribe, ... to grammars
  - `::commands` for a `CommandRegistry` - more about this below
  - `::views` for a `ViewRegistry` - provide view for a model ("View Provider association")
  - a `StyleManager` for getting or subscribing to style elements
  - a `TooltipManager` for displaying one or more tooltips
  - a `PackageManager` for "coordinating the lifecycle" of packages
  - a `DeserializerManager` for deserializing packages
  - as well as clipboard, themes, menu, keymaps and more
- subscriptions - only for a handful of "extended method" events taking callbacks
  - did beep
  - will throw / did throw error
  - shell environment loaded
    - on load or immediately if is loaded
    - callback only called on unhandled error
- details
  - whether Atom is in dev/safe/spec mode
  - get version, release channel (`dev`/`beta`/`stable`)
  - check if released version
  - load time, load settings
- managing window
  - open, close, get/set size (of window), get/set position (of window)
  - extended methods include focus, show/hide, reload, set/check fullscreen and more
- messaging users
  - beep
  - confirm - alert-like dialog async or sync (recommended callback gets selected index)
- dev tools - only a few "extended methods"
  - open, toggle, execute JS

## Color
- returned from `Config::get`
- method for parsing string or object to color
- methods for converting to hex/rgba

## CommandRegistry
- global `atom.commands`
  - commands here findable in Command Palette
- listeners <-> commands, with CSS selectors
- event handling is jQuery-like "event delegation"
  - custom DOM events
  - on focused element
  - through keybinding or Command Palette
- this is instead of binding listeners to DOM nodes
  - attach to `atom.commands`
  - then constrain using CSS selectors
- pattern: `namespace:action`
  - `namespace` is usually the package name
  - `action` is the command's behavior
  - words separated by `-` and all lowercase
- listener call order (parallels CSS cascade)
  - event bubbles up through DOM
  - listeners invoked by specificity (more to less)
  - ties resolved by invoking most recent listener
  - event context: `this` points to `event.currentTarget`
  - `stopPropagation`/`stopImmediatePropagation` stop bubbling and avoid triggering more listeners
- methods include:
  - add command listener to element
  - find, dispatch, on will/did dispatch

## CompositeDisposable
- collects multiple `Disposable` objects
  - `Disposable` objects are returned when subscribing
  - `Disposable` object has method for checking if disposable
  - `Disposable` objects have constructor and destructor (`dispose()`) methods
  - composites dispose these in a group
- methods for constructor and disposal
- collection methods for adding, removing one `Disposable`
- `delete` is an alias for the remove method
- method for clearing the collection
