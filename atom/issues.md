- conflicting info about default movement and selection keybindings
  - where: 2 > Moving in Atom > Additional Movement and Selection Commands
  - uri: https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/moving-in-atom/#additional-movement-and-selection-commands
  - description: the text explains that "the command `editor:move-to-beginning-of-screen-line` is available in the command palette, but it's not bound to any key combination", but two fenced blocks below this `editor:move-to-beginning-of-screen-line` is listed as one of the "Movement and Selection Commands that have a keyboard shortcut by default"

- heading text lacks prescribed title-case
  - where: 2 > GitHub package
  - uri: https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/github-package/
  - description: most multiword headings in this section are not title-cased, which conflicts with the [language guidelines]( https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#language) in CONTRIBUTING.md.

- heading text lacks prescribed title-case
  - where: 2 > Version Control in Atom
  - uri: https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/version-control-in-atom/
  - description: most multiword headings in this section are not title-cased, which conflicts with the [language guidelines]( https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#language) in CONTRIBUTING.md.

- text uses "hit" instead of prescribed "press"
  - where: 2 > Writing in Atom
  - uri: https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/writing-in-atom/
  - description: keypress instructions under Spell Checking state to "pull up a menu of possible corrections by _hitting_ <kbd>Cmd+Shift+;</kbd>" (italics mine). Later, the Snippets subsection gives two instructions to "hit `tab`". These conflict with the [language guidelines]( https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#language) in CONTRIBUTING.md.
