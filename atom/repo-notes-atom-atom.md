# Repo notes: atom/atom

## Overview
- README checks the basic boxes but lacks any path into the code base
  - test shields
  - mentions and links to Electron
  - product description, including links to community and code of conduct
  - links to documentation: Flight Manual and API Reference (see my notes)
  - installation prerequisites and OS steps
  - links to building instructions
  - license
- how to know the code?
  - existing docs don't directly answer that question
- goals of this doc:
  - break down and understand the codebase from a wide view
  - trace a beginning path through the code to gain that understanding

## Basic Branching
- `apm` for Atom Package Manager
  - just an install folder for APM: https://github.com/atom/apm
  - most use cases covered by APM command line tool
  - API info: https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.29.0/PackageManager
  - Flight Manual: https://flight-manual.atom.io/atom-server-side-apis/sections/atom-package-server-api/
  - an [example of how Atom uses apm](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/blob/master/lib/package-manager.coffee)
- `benchmark` for a benchmark runner and large file / long line tests
- `docs` for building documentation
  - focused on platform-specific instructions for building Atom from source
  - this was moved to the Flight Manual
  - `./focus` contains a doc [sharing current plans](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/docs/focus)
- `dot-atom` contains the files and directories that install to `.atom`
  - including the custom stylesheet and keymap files
  - including the custom packages directory
- `exports` requires and exports objects
  - requires and exports a bunch of src objects that all seem to deal with file and buffer load/events
    - including Task and TextEditor when not a child node process (meaning when process type is `'renderer'`)
  - also contains a handful of Electron API shims using [grim.deprecate](https://github.com/atom/grim/blob/master/src/grim.coffee)
- `keymaps`
  - cson keybinding maps for various platforms
  - `base.cson` has selectors for `atom-text-editor` and many `body` default to native
  - movement, selection and many other bindings for `darwin`, `linux`, `win32`
- `menus`
  - three files containing array of menu items for different platforms
  - objects contain a `label` and `submenu` arrays of objects with `label` and `command`
- `resources`
  - png app icons
  - shell script, js and apm shell and command scripts for `win` installation
  - long bundle info plist for `mac`
  - debian and redhat package for `linux`
- `script`
  - a variety of scripts for building Atom
  - linter scripts
  - version and platform sensitive installation, cleaning, transpiling
  - `vsts` subfolder
    - contains its own README
    - scripts for automating Atom releases
    - `yml` files for configuring releases
    - tasks for handling release branch on different platforms
    - uses Visual Studio Team Services
      - [multi-phase jobs](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/blob/master/docs/preview/yamlgettingstarted-jobs.md)
      - generate Atom installation packages on all three platforms
      - publish new release on successful build
    - Atom Nightly packages published to GitHub and atom.io
    - version release numbers calculated by `generate-version.js`
      - nightly release number incremented after comparing base version against `package.json`
    - phase templates build Atom simultaneously across platforms
    - successful build release artifacts uploaded to S3 bucket
- `spec`
  - quite a large directory with many CoffeeScript and JS `-spec` files
  - Jasmine `describe` tests
    - run for Atom environment, paths, clipboard, installation, grammar registry, style manager and much more
    - the project settings `config` spec is a long, representative example: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/spec/config-spec.js
  - `./helpers` directory contains a random line builder and a very long lexicon
  - `./fixtures` contains samples with extreme formatting, example packages, sample themes
  - `./main-process` contains the application test and command line test
- `src`
  - `./main-process` subdirectory contains application start, menu, win updater and more
    - the short `main.js` is where the start path is built
    - `parse-command-line.js` breaks down cli args and returns object with all the process info
    - `start.js` is called from `main`
      - runs the command line parser and stores the resulting `args`
      - sets up `app.on` events for opening files, launching and ready
      - requires `./main-process/atom-application` and runs `.open` with `args`
      - defines a `getConfig` function to read the config file
  - the rest of the directory is many `.js` and `.coffee` files
    - class exports for many of the objects documented in the API
      - for example, [Package](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.29.0/Package) relates to `package.js`
      - that example defines `onDidDeactivate (callback) { ... }` mentioned in the API docs
      - others include everything from `gutter` to `pane` to `cursor` to global `config-file`
    - `grammar-registry` is an example with many requires, complex class methods, much to think through
    - some API doc classes come from other sources imported into these `src` files
      - like `Emitter` from `event-kit`
        - for example, the `package.js` mentioned above requires and instantiates `Emitter`, then `onDidDeactivate` returns `emitter.on()` event with your callback
      - or like `Disposable` and `CompositeDisposable` from `event-kit`
    - some scripts provide other functionality
      - like how `crash-reporter-start` requires and starts CrashReporter from `electron`
      - or how `babel` creates a babel version and compiles source using babel
- `static`
  - `.less` files for editor, cursors, docks, syntax and much more
  - stylesheet fallback variables
  - basic html template `index.html`
  - window load and setup script in `index.js`
  - and the octocat spinner!
- `vendor`
  - Jasmine tests for JS and JQuery
