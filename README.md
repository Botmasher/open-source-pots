# OpenSourcePots
Documenting one human developer's aspiration to contribute to and grow in open source

## Description
Welcome to where I plan to annotate and play my way through my ongoing journey to become a better and more contributing developer. I created this repo to help me plant open source pots, which when nurtured well may grow into skills for me and flourishing for open features that are yet to be.

## Visualization
This is a todo for me, or a nice-to-have, but I'd like to create some simple UI or visualizations to track my progress. Preferably with pots and plants and produce, since that's my imagery. At the very least, I can make myself a nice image so this README isn't just text wall.

## Collaborating
I can't promise this info will matter to anyone else, but you're welcome to whatever I've learned here. May you take it and use it to make something better. If you'd like to add notes or try abstracting a general way to get into projects from this specific journey, I'm happy to cooperate!
